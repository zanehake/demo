# demo
a demo project from kids can code

'''
Game play idea
adding a object falling from the top of the screen to make the gameplay more difficult
Made a sprite very similar to the mob but instread of moving horizontally it falls horizontally from the top of the screen
I went a bad way about doing this because instead of creating a new sprite i copied much of the mobs code and had a lot of trouble 
figuring out the code and how to manipulate what it does so that it moves and spawns where i want

also had the idea of adding a powerup that changed the jump to a higher number but was not able to tackle this one

Bugs; obj fall from the side of screen not directly on top and fall diagonally

Made the platforms into cake & powerup into golder carrots & a couple more changes
